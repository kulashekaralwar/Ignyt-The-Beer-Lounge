Great! If you want to **stress test an EC2 instance** to trigger **Auto Scaling in AWS**, you're basically simulating high resource usage (CPU, memory, etc.) to see if your **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** adds or removes instances based on your defined policies.

Hereâ€™s a full guide to do it right:

## âœ… Step-by-Step: Stress Test EC2 for Auto Scaling

### 1. **Set Up Your Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**

Make sure you have:
- A **Launch Template** or **Launch Configuration**
- An **Auto Scaling Group** created with:
  - Min, Max, and Desired capacity
  - Associated target EC2 instance type
  - Attached to a **load balancer** or **target group** (optional but useful)
- Scaling **Policies** based on CPU, memory, or custom CloudWatch metrics

### Example: Scaling policy based on average CPU > 70% for 5 minutes.

---

### 2. **Install Stress Tool on EC2 Instance**

Once your instance is running, SSH into it and install a stress-testing tool.

#### For Amazon Linux / Ubuntu:

```bash
# Amazon Linux
sudo yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum install -y stress

# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y stress
```

---

### 3. **Run the Stress Test**

Use the `stress` tool to simulate CPU load:

```bash
# Stress all CPU cores for 5 minutes
stress --cpu $(nproc) --timeout 300
```

You can also simulate other resources:

```bash
# Stress CPU, RAM, and Disk I/O
stress --cpu 4 --io 2 --vm 2 --vm-bytes 512M --timeout 300
```

This will drive up usage and trigger your scaling policies if configured correctly.

---

### 4. **Monitor in CloudWatch**

Go to:
- **CloudWatch â†’ Metrics â†’ EC2 / ASG / CPUUtilization**
- **CloudWatch â†’ Alarms** to see if the alarm triggered scaling

You should see:
- CPU % spike
- CloudWatch Alarm change to **ALARM**
- Auto Scaling Group launch a new instance (within a few mins)

---

### 5. **Verify New Instance Launches**

Go to **EC2 Dashboard** â†’ see if more instances show up under the same ASG. You can also check the **Activity History** in the Auto Scaling Group page.

---

### 6. **Optional: Create Load with Apache Benchmark or Locust**

If your instance runs a web server, use tools like:

- `ab` (Apache Benchmark):
```bash
ab -n 10000 -c 100 http://<your-ec2-public-ip>/
```

- `locust` (Python-based load test tool):
```bash
pip install locust
locust -f locustfile.py
```

---

## ðŸ§  Pro Tips

- **Cooldown periods**: Set a cooldown to prevent flapping (too frequent scaling).
- **Use target tracking policies**: Easier and more dynamic than step policies.
- **Test scale-in too**: Once the load drops, ASG should reduce instance count.

Want a script or CloudFormation template to set this up faster? Or want to simulate traffic instead of just CPU load?
