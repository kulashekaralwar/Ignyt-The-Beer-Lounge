Thanks for sharing the image. Here's a clear breakdown of **QUESTION 1: Simulating Storage Virtualization with Loop Devices on WSL**, along with a simplified guide to help you execute it in WSL:

---

### **Objective**  
Learn storage virtualization using loopback devices to simulate virtual disks in a **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** environment.

---

### **Task**  
Simulate a storage virtualization setup using **Logical Volume Manager (LVM)** with loopback files acting as virtual disks.

---

### **Instructions (Steps with Sample Commands)**

1. **Create two empty `.img` files of 50MB**:
   ```bash
   dd if=/dev/zero of=disk1.img bs=1M count=50
   dd if=/dev/zero of=disk2.img bs=1M count=50
   ```

2. **Associate the files with loop devices**:
   ```bash
   losetup -fP disk1.img
   losetup -fP disk2.img
   ```

3. **Verify the loop devices**:
   ```bash
   losetup -a
   ```

4. **Initialize the loop devices as physical volumes**:
   ```bash
   sudo pvcreate /dev/loopX /dev/loopY   # Replace X and Y with actual loop numbers
   ```

5. **Create a volume group**:
   ```bash
   sudo vgcreate myvg /dev/loopX /dev/loopY
   ```

6. **Create a 50MB logical volume**:
   ```bash
   sudo lvcreate -L 50M -n mylv myvg
   ```

7. **Format the logical volume with ext4**:
   ```bash
   sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/myvg/mylv
   ```

8. **Create a mount directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/mymount
   ```

9. **Mount the logical volume**:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/myvg/mylv ~/mymount
   ```

10. **Create a file, write data, unmount, and remount elsewhere**:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello from LVM!" > ~/mymount/hello.txt
   sudo umount ~/mymount
   sudo mkdir /tmp/mymount
   sudo mount /dev/myvg/mylv /tmp/mymount
   cat /tmp/mymount/hello.txt
   ```
